                       WELCOME!
                        
    Welcome to Waydog Trixie, a version that uses
    Wayland rather than x11 for the display.
    
    Waydog uses Labwc for the window manager, and
    Waybar for panel. Keybinds are handled within
    the Window managers. Most programs will be up
    to the user to choose.
    
    Please visit the forum for more information:
    https://sourceforge.net/p/lilidog/discussion/

    The live environment passwords are 'user' for
    username, and 'live' for root.
    
    To install Waydog, reboot the iso and select:
    'Start installer'.

    After installation, use the welcome script to
    see other initial setup options. You can also
    type 'welcome' in a terminal for use later.
