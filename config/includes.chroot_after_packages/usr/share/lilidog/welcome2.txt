                       WELCOME!
                        
    Welcome to Waydog Trixie. You most likely see
    the live screen size is not correct.
    
    The live environment is not meant for Wayland
    but I think folks should see the setup if one
    wants to install.  The screen size is correct
    on installation.  Take the leap!
    
    Please visit the forum for more information:

    The live environment passwords are 'user' for
    username, and 'live' for root.
    
    To install Waydog, reboot the iso and select:
    'Start installer'.

    After installation, use the welcome script to
    see other initial setup options. You can also
    type 'welcome' in a terminal for use later.
