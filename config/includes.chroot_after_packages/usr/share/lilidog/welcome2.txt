                       WELCOME!
                        
    Welcome to Waydog Trixie, a version that uses
    Wayland, rather than x11 for the display.
    
    Waydog uses Labwc for the window manager, and
    Waybar for panel. All keybinds are handled by
    swhkd.  All other programs are up to the user
    to choose, aside from a few select choices.
    
    Please visit the forum for more information:
    https://sourceforge.net/p/lilidog/discussion/

    The live environment passwords are 'user' for
    username, and 'live' for root.
    
    To install Waydog, reboot the iso and select:
    'Start installer'.

    After installation, use the welcome script to
    see other initial setup options. You can also
    type 'welcome' in a terminal for use later.
