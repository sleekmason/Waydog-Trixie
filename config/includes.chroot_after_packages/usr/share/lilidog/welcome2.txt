                       WELCOME!
                        
    Welcome to Waydog Trixie, a version that uses
    Wayland rather than x11 for the display.
    
    Waydog has Labwc for the window manager along
    with Waybar for the panel as default. Sway WM
    is a separate option at login. Look around to
    see how to customize further.
    
    Please visit the forum for more information:
    https://sourceforge.net/p/lilidog/discussion/

    The live environment passwords are 'user' for
    username, and 'live' for root.
    
    To install Waydog, reboot the iso and select:
    'Start installer'.

    After installation, use the welcome script to
    see other initial setup options. You can also
    type 'welcome' in a terminal for use later.
